Heya hiya! I’m a trans woman and general online creator. I’m a vtuber, fantasy fiction writer, containerfile smith, and musician. I love tech nerdery and art and artists. I’m a communist/progressive/leftist. I’m pan, and I have a great many mental differences, including autism and ADHD.

Despite having greek names, I’m not greek. I’m italian american, but I mostly denounce my nationality and my family name. My first name is partially but not entirely inspired by the [linux fox](https://xenia.efi.pages.gay/). I actually just kinda love the concept of [xenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_(Greek)).

My best and coolest projects you might be most interested in/I have worked the hardest on are my [gaming youtube channel, especially my vtuber videos and video essays](https://www.youtube.com/@BwarchTheGamer/videos)

My bootc image, [my personalized linux operating system XeniaOS](https://github.com/XeniaMeraki/XeniaOS)

My various musical albums I've made, [world and ambient and electronic music](https://xeniameraki.bandcamp.com/)

My [Discord Server I personally run](https://discord.gg/gkZWX4E), you might think that's silly to include but I'm genuinely proud of the community I've made, and it takes up a lot of my time talking in there and giving everyone's thoughts and projects my attention.
