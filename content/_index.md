Despite having greek names, I’m not greek. I’m italian american, but I mostly denounce my nationality and my family name. My first name is partially but not entirely inspired by the [linux fox](https://xenia.efi.pages.gay/). I actually just kinda love the concept of [xenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_(Greek)).
