<p style="text-align: center;"><small>AKA Bwarch-isms</small></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #a6e3a1;">Xenia-isms</span> are first defined by innocence,</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">and then by malicious spite til the end of days.</p>

{{ youtube(id="rQGmgJ7nx4Y") }}

{{ indent (n=2) }}Xenia-isms are when I mispronounce something in my head or in conversations for a good long while, before someone tells me "it's not actually pronounced that way", and I decide to **KEEP** pronouncing it that way out of sheer spite for both the informer and the english language as a whole. It is indeed innocent at first, I am a book and online reader and often have to guess at pronounciations, and out loud conversations come up relatively not that often for me.

{{ indent (n=2) }}The first of these that was ever unearthed was indeed <span style="color: #a6e3a1;">gif</span>, which would normally be pronounced "giff" or "jiff", and instead I say "jife", akin to "knife". Because there were the two camps already created and this online flame war has been happening since the beginning of (internet) time, I felt zero need whatsoever to course correct. Language is silly and malleable and I decided to form it into my ideal structure by sheer force of will.

Xenia-isms by preference can be word pronounciations but sometimes entire phrases or structure of a sentence.

Other Xenia-isms unlocked so far:

<mark>Key: base (Xenia way) {actual way}</mark>

- gif (jife)
- unmitigated (un-might-uh-gated) {unmit-uh-gated}
- aesthetic (ae-es-thetic) {us-thetic}
- berated (bear-ated) {burated}
- appointment (I'm going to a psychologist hookup on friday)
- plaidd (Played) {Plad}
- willy nilly (nilly willy)
- blahaj (Blah-hodge) {blo-high}

<mark><span style="color: #f5c2e7;">noelle</span></mark>: how do you personally pronounce GUI?

<mark><span style="color: #f5c2e7;">noelle</span></mark>: G-U-I or do y'all actually say guey

<mark><span style="color: #f38ba8;">Sister Azzy</span></mark>: gee you I

<mark><span style="color: #f5c2e7;">noelle</span></mark>: Same

<mark><span style="color: #cba6f7;">Capt. Lix Skye</span></mark>: G-U-I

<mark><span style="color: #f5c2e7;">noelle</span></mark>: Based

<mark><span style="color: #a6e3a1;">⚧ Xenia</span> <span style="color: #fab387;">Demonheart ☭</span></mark>: Gooey

<mark><span style="color: #f5c2e7;">noelle</span></mark>: whenigottakilltonyhawkintheracewar.gif

<mark><span style="color: #cba6f7;">Capt. Lix Skye</span></mark>: I do not believe you

<mark><span style="color: #a6e3a1;">⚧ Xenia</span> <span style="color: #fab387;">Demonheart ☭</span></mark>: bocchigivemethatdoritosdumbass.gif

<mark><span style="color: #f5c2e7;">noelle</span></mark>: dfiugdsfgjkdsfgdfsg

<mark><span style="color: #cba6f7;">Capt. Lix Skye</span></mark>: I don't think there's a human alive that says it like that

<mark><span style="color: #f5c2e7;">noelle</span></mark>: The reason I asked is because the guy in this one video said like gooey as well

<mark><span style="color: #a6e3a1;">⚧ Xenia</span> <span style="color: #fab387;">Demonheart ☭</span></mark>: I would say it's common enough to be two parties.

<mark><span style="color: #a6e3a1;">⚧ Xenia</span> <span style="color: #fab387;">Demonheart ☭</span></mark>: Much like gif

<mark><span style="color: #f5c2e7;">noelle</span></mark>: From looking at it online it seems like gooey is more common for millenials/90s kids, and GUI is something from later

<mark><span style="color: #a6e3a1;">⚧ Xenia</span> <span style="color: #fab387;">Demonheart ☭</span></mark>: Interesting

<mark><span style="color: #cdd6f4;">hoof</span></mark>: gooey gang

<mark><span style="color: #cba6f7;">Capt. Lix Skye</span></mark>: HUH. WHAT. I'VE. HUH.

<mark><span style="color: #cdd6f4;">hoof</span></mark>: I think a lot of ppl who call computers/phones/tablets/etc “machines” probably fall into this category

<mark><span style="color: #a6e3a1;">⚧ Xenia</span> <span style="color: #fab387;">Demonheart ☭</span></mark>: I fuckin love yerl, thank you for this gift

<mark><span style="color: #f38ba8;">Sister Azzy</span></mark>: don't ask bwarch how they say gif

<mark><span style="color: #cba6f7;">Capt. Lix Skye</span></mark>: im scared

<mark><span style="color: #f38ba8;">Sister Azzy</span></mark>: so you know how everyone says it like gif, but the correct way of saying it is jif?

<mark><span style="color: #f38ba8;">Sister Azzy</span></mark>: guess which way bwarch says it

<mark><span style="color: #a6e3a1;">⚧ Xenia</span> <span style="color: #fab387;">Demonheart ☭</span></mark>: [Above video link]

<mark><span style="color: #cba6f7;">Capt. Lix Skye</span></mark>:

<mark><span style="color: #a6adc8;">puyo plop</span></mark>: Jife has been in my lexicon ever since that damn video

<mark><span style="color: #a6e3a1;">⚧ Xenia</span> <span style="color: #fab387;">Demonheart ☭</span></mark>: I'm so glad
