"[Xenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_(Greek)) is an ancient Greek concept of hospitality. It is almost always translated as 'guest-friendship' or 'ritualized friendship'.It is an institutionalized relationship rooted in generosity, gift exchange, and reciprocity. Historically, hospitality towards foreigners and guests was understood as a moral obligation, as well as a political imperative."

{{ indent (n=2) }}<span style="color: #a6e3a1;">Xenia</span> as a name and concept to me is one of ultimate kindness and societal community. It's the concept of being kind to strangers, or the unknown passersby, or the elderly, or the mentally ill, as much as possible for as long as possible. It's about feeding the homeless and those down on their luck. But just as much kindness as in xenia as there is, there is anger and justice as well. You are *not* kind to those who have hurt others, you are not kind to police, you are not kind to fascists and nazis.

The image is divided into horizontal panels with a bold red, gray, and beige color palette and cartoon-style figures. Top panel: A question reads, “Should a tolerant society tolerate intolerance?” On the right, a bald extremist figure holding a flaming torch and wearing Nazi symbols says, “You want more tolerance? Respect my ideas!” The text answers emphatically: “The answer is NO.” Second panel: Text explains, “It’s a paradox, but unlimited tolerance can lead to the extinction of tolerance.” On the left, a person says, “Let’s give them a chance!” while a historical-looking figure resembling Hitler stands nearby. On the right, a large cross-like structure and a crowd of uniformed figures with Nazi armbands march beneath a leader, illustrating the rise of fascism. Text continues: “…the tolerant ones end up being destroyed, and tolerance with them.” Third panel: A violent scene shows an extremist being kicked or forcibly removed. Text states: “Any movement that preaches intolerance and persecution must be outside of the law.” Bottom panel: A cartoon of Karl Popper gestures with open hands. The concluding text reads: "As paradoxical as it may seem, defending tolerance… requires to not tolerate the intolerant."')

{{ indent (n=2) }}This may or may not be a bastardization slightly of the original concept of xenia, which only speaks of kindness and not of justice. But I CHOOSE to inject my modern [punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_subculture) values into this ancient concept and mold it to my worldview. I CHOOSE to believe that justice IS kindness ultimately. Infinite kindness is just as deadly to community as infinite visciousness is. Xenia is about knowing who is in power, that power structures exist, and about being kind to those who are not in power and are not ultimately a threat to you. Xenia is about being against the death penalty, while doing our best to topple the power structures that puts the weak and mentally ill to death.

{{ indent (n=2) }}Kindness to strangers is impossible when people are not allowed to BE strangers. The United States is currently against immigration, against the homeless, against the very concept of travel. Clinging to the absurd concept of borders and walls, gating their communities, rebuffing strangers in favor of only the Known, The Powerful, The White. Xenia as a concept goes against the values of the average American citizen, and so be it. They are wrong on a great many principles, on a great many aspects of morality and kindness as a whole.
