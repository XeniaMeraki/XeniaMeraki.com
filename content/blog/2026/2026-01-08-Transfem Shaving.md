{{ indent (n=2) }}<span style="color: #a6e3a1;">Personally</span> I like using a safety blade razor for Everything. Face, body, limbs. Generally there are five-ish types of razor. Disposables, safety razor, electric razor, electric (grill) razor, epilators. I haven't used the last two, I cannot comment on them, and they are more expensive anyway. We have an easy crown king champ for both budget and usefulness ratio, and that's safety razor.

{{ indent (n=2) }}I'll be referring to this Matpat video for some details because it's useful for some of my points. Keep in mind the video is *about* and *aimed* at cis guys, but we can do some takeaways by process of elimination. 

But #1: Safety razors are absurdly cheap. 20usd for a decent Amazon special safety razor and 10usd for 100 blades that will last probably 3 years. VS paying 80usd for an electric razor that will need new proprietary blades in a year, or paying 5usd for a disposable razor that will last for 1-5 uses.

{{ indent (n=2) }}My routine personally is to body shave every 4-7 days, and shave my face basically every day unless depression gets to me that day. Hot water and exfoliation is your best friend, it weakens the hair and makes it less likely to make mistakes/hurt yourself. What is exfoliation? Exfoliating is simply rubbing a wash cloth or loofah over the area you'll soon remove hair from. It'll remove dead skin and probably some other stuff on a molecular level.

{{ indent (n=2) }}So yeah I mean, people don't go with safety razors and they're sadly not popular because they're *sharp* and *technically* dangerous. But if you're careful and learn slowly I truly think most people will be fine. I made something like 4ish small mistakes with safety razor shaving, small 1cm or less slices. 1cm slice on my ankle. Going over my kneecaps and not being careful about a rounded spot. (Be very careful around rounded spots) But now months into using safety razor and I love it and basically don't make mistakes anymore.

{{ indent (n=2) }}**SHAVING CREAM IS COMPLETELY OPTIONAL I ASSURE YOU. YOU DO NOT NEED IT. IT IS SPECIFICALLY IF YOUR HAIR NEEDS INSTANT HYDRATING OR YOU HAVE A HAIR TYPE THAT SPECIFICALLY NEEDS IT. I AIN'T USED SHAVING CREAM. IT'S SPECIFICALLY MADE FOR PEOPLE WITH JOBS WHO NEED A VERY QUICK SHAVE IN THE MORNING AND THEN OUT THE DOOR, IF YOU GOT THE TIME FOR A HOT SHOWER, OR EVEN WARMING UP YOUR SINK FAUCET, YOU DO NOT NEED SHAVING CREAM**

{{ indent (n=2) }}Matpat and co in that above video end up not liking safety razors because they, as cis masculine guys, end up LIKING a bit of stubble and five o' clock shadow left over. Especially from electric shavers. What does that mean for us transfems? That means safety razors are PERFECT for our use case of wanting as little hair on our face as possible.

{{ indent (n=2) }}For crotch and butt, I do shave crotch related hair with the safety razor, but I did take my time getting GOOD with one before attempting that area. I lightly recommend Trying the razor-less solution [Magic Powder](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=magic%20powder%20hair%20removal&ia=web) for crotch and butt hair. It basically melts hair off of you chemically. It works for some people, and for some people they find it hard to mix properly or it doesn't work quite right for their skin or hair. I HIGHLY recommend a spot test if you buy some Magic Powder.

{{ indent (n=2) }}Now a safety razor won't get rid of all the hair even if it is just about the closest shave you can get easily. You still have the "bud" of the "plant", if you have dark hair like I do pepper-ish spots will remain. These you would want to cover up with [makeup concealer](https://youtu.be/sKOF4CeZaxI), and if you wanted to get rid of hair permanently, well that's obviously when laser and electrolysis comes into play. SADLY THE STATE OF ARIZONA DOES NOT COVER LASER HAIR REMOVAL UNDER MEDICAID SO IDK WHEN I'M EVER GONNA BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT <span style="color: #fab387;">SHIT.</span>
